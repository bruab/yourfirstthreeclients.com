Eventually, everyone you know will [know you're freelancing](/let-people-know-youre-freelancing). But since you're sending [one thoughtful message at a time](/thoughtful-messages), you'll want to prioritize who you reach out to first.

So, start with the people you know who are connected to lots of other people, and who enjoy making introductions. 

These people might have a large following on social media. They might manage a community, or host events. Or they might simply be that friend who _knows everyone_.
