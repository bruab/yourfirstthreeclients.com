Once a potential client is familiar with your work, and trusts you, they'll want to work together—it's just a matter of [timing](/timing-is-everything-unfortunately/).

All you have to do is make sure they remember you when the moment comes. To do _that_, you just have to reach out once in a while.

Easy enough, but ... reach out and say _what_? Here are some options.

## Share something related to a previous conversation

When you come across an article, data point, or anecdote that relates directly to something they've told you, send it along. This can feel formulaic if you do it too often—they didn't ask you to become their news feed—but if it's only once in a while, and you tie it back to your conversations, it's a nice way to keep in touch.

## Go on quests (and invite them)

Be the person in their circle who's always investigating some mildly interesting problem. Let them know when you start a new quest, and consider asking for their help. Send them an occasional update if you learn something interesting. And share your conclusions when you're done.

## Ask them if they need help (once in a while)

Once or twice a year, it's okay to ask about work TODO
