Once a potential client is familiar with your work, and trusts you, they'll want to work together—it's just a matter of [timing](/timing-is-everything-unfortunately/).

All you have to do is make sure they remember you when the moment comes. To do _that_, you just have to reach out once in a while.

Easy enough, but ... reach out and say _what_? Here are some options.

## Share something related to a previous conversation

When you come across an article, data point, or anecdote that relates directly to something they've told you, send it along. 

This can feel formulaic if you do it too often—they didn't ask you to become their news feed—but if it's only once in a while, and you tie it back to your conversations, it's a nice way to keep in touch.

## Go on quests (and invite them)

Be the person in their circle who's always investigating some mildly interesting problem. Let them know when you start a new [quest](https://garden.briandavidhall.com/quests-are-better-than-pitches), and consider asking for their help. Send an occasional update if you learn something interesting. And share your conclusions when you're done.

## Ask them if they need help (once in a while)

Once or twice a year, it's okay to ask about working together.

If you've previously discussed a particular type of project, just let them know you're still interested—without being pushy or presumptuous.

> ... I remember you saying you might want to talk about some social media strategy help once you finished the rebrand, just thought I'd check in on that. I'd love to chat about it but I also realize these projects have a way of dragging on :)
> 
> Let me know if it makes sense to meet—otherwise I'll assume you've got other priorities.

If you _haven't_ explicitly talked about working together, casually communicate your interest without seeming needy:

> ... I'm lining up projects for Q1 (cannot believe it's already October!) and wanted to check in to see if by chance you'll be looking for paid search help anytime soon.
> 
> If so, what a coincidence & we should chat! If not, no worries. I'll check in again when I've got something interesting to share.
