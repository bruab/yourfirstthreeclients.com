All the familiarity, trust, and good will in the world won't drive someont to hire you _until they need your help_.

And the forces that converge to create that need are mostly outside your control. If you're a web designer, you can't _make_ a brand decide to redesign their site. If you're an audio producer, you can't _force_ an agency to launch a new podcast.

The best and only thing you can do about this is work to ensure that you're the first person they think of whenever the need does arise.

One way to do this is to become an influencer on social media and spend 20+ hours a week making videos and writing posts about the work you do, in order to ensure they see your face every time they pick up their phone. 

But that sounds exhausting, doesn't it? A much easier approach is to [stay in touch with potential clients, forever](/stay-in-touch-with-potential-clients-forever).
