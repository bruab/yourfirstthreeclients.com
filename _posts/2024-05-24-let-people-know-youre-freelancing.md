title: "Let people know you're freelancing"

You probably know some [people who could hypothetically hire you](/people-who-hire-freelancers), and you _definitely_ know people who know some _other_ people who could hire you.

These people—do they know you're looking for clients, and what kind of work you can do?

If not, fixing that is an important first step.

Do this one person, and one [thoughtful message](/thoughtful-messages) at a time.

For people you're close to, a simple email or text will do:

> Hey, I'm on the lookout for freelance web dev work. Let me know if you know anybody who's starting a business or thinking about a redesign!

That's all it takes—now at least they know you're available. They may or may not be able to hire you, they may or may not be able to connect you to a potential client, but at least it's now a possibility.

When it comes to someone you haven't talked to in a while, there are a couple options. 

If appropriate, ask them for advice. (See "[Thoughtful messages](/thoughtful-messages)")

If that doesn't make sense (e.g. you're a motion graphics designer and they're a sous chef), try to facilitate a general catchup conversation, and just be sure to mention that you're freelancing.

> Hey, long time no chat. Are you still taking all the blame and none of the credit in Chef Grayson's kitchen? :) 
>
> Personally I finally reached the point where I decided I need a change, looking around for some freelance motion graphics gigs. We should catch up and commiserate sometime.

If you find you have zero interest in reaching out to someone, that's fine—strike them from your list. Your goal is to make sure that the people you know and like, and who know and like you, are aware of what you're up to. So they can help.

An [address book audit](/address-book-audit) can be a helpful tool for structuring this exercise.
