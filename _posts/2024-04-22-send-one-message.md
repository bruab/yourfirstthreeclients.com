Do you know some [people who hire freelancers](/people-who-hire-freelancers/)? Probably.

Does every single one of them know that you're looking for work? Probably not.

Let's fix that.

Your goal for now is to send one (1) message to one (1) person who might, theoretically, hire you. At some point. 

But you won't ask them to hire you, because that would be awkward.

Instead, just send a [thoughtful message](/thoughtful-messages/). Be honest about what you're up to:

> I'm getting started with freelancing and trying to figure out the sales and marketing side of it.

... and ask for their help:

> I figure that's something you've got some experience withâ€”at least from the client's perspective. 
> 
> Any chance you'd be free for a 15 minute chat about how you've found and hired freelancers in the past? Red flags, nightmare scenarios, advice you might be willing to share? Absolutely no worries if you're busy this month.

Given the candid nature of this request, you'll want to start with someone you know fairly well, someone you expect will be happy to help.

Can you think of one person who might be willing to have this type of conversation with you? Send them a message, now.

Then consider doing an [address book audit](/address-book-audit/).
