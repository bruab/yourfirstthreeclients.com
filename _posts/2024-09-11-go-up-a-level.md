Take the work you do and consider: What department does it typically fall under? Marketing, operations, product development?

Ask your [potential clients](/people-who-hire-freelancers) to tell you about their most pressing issues in that _department_, and be on the lookout for problems you can help solve. But also: be prepared to learn that their biggest, most urgent needs are outside of your realm of expertise.

If you're a social media manager, you will probably ask about their marketing challenges. If they reply by saying their website gets plenty of traffic, but nobody signs up for their software ... it's unlikely they're a good fit for you. At least [at the moment](/timing-is-everything-unfortunately). Listen, empathize, and wrap up by offering an introduction to someone you know who does web design, UX, or analytics. Then [stay in touch](/stay-in-touch-with-potential-clients-forever).

On the other hand, if they complain that nobody knows about their product, or they've tried running ads but didn't get any customers, or—ideally—they're overwhelmed with managing their social profiles, encourage them to go into detail. How long has this been a problem? What have they tried in the past? What would change for their business if they could solve this problem?

It might take several conversations before you meet someone whose most pressing problem is exactly what you're good at solving. But when it happens, you'll notice—you're not selling to them, they're selling to themselves. They'll happily outline why they need the kind of help you give, and why it's a top priority. They'll know exactly how transformative it will be, if done well. And at some point, they'll want to hear your ideas on what they should do.
