Assuming you've [sent one message](/send-one-message/), it probably makes sense to spend some time assessing who you know, who you want to work with, and who might want to work with _you_.

Take a quick look at the types of [people who hire freelancers](/people-who-hire-freelancers/), then open up your email contacts, phone contacts, or social media connections.

(Just pick one of those options for now. You're only going to spend 10-15 minutes at this, and you'll do it again week or two.)

_Slowly_ scroll through the names in front of you. For each person, ask:

- Could they (hypothetically) hire me?
- Would I _like_ working with them?
- Do I like _talking_ to them?

As soon as you come to a name that gets a "yes, yes, yes," stop. Send them a [thoughtful message](/thoughtful-messages/).

If you've still got some energy, continue down the list. If not, no problemâ€”come back to this audit in a few days.
