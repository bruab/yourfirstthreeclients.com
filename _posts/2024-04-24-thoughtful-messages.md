title: "Thoughtful messages"
---

The messages you will send as you find your first three clients are the exact opposite of whatever you think of when you hear the phrase "sales emails."

You will never send bulk emails, for one. You won't use clickbaity subject lines. They won't come off as cold and impersonal. And for the most part, they will not be ignored.

Here's an example of a thoughtful message you might send:

> Hi NAME, I wanted to ask a favor. Not sure if I've mentioned it, but I'm hanging up my shingle as a freelance graphic designer. 
> 
> The sales and marketing side of freelancing are completely foreign to me, but I figured it's something you've got some experience with—at least from the client's perspective. 
>
> Any chance you'd be free for a 15 minute chat about how you've found and hired freelancers in the past? Red flags, nightmare scenarios, advice you might be willing to share? Absolutely no worries if you're busy this month.

And here's what makes it thoughtful:

- It's short
- It lets them know what kind of work you're open to, without pitching
- It's sincere, and vulnerable—you're openly asking for help, rather than being cagey about your actual intent
- It's easy for them to say yes—you only want a 15 minute chat
- It's easy for them to say _no_—you provide an excuse so they don't have to think of one

If you haven't yet, please take the time to [send one message](/send-one-message/) to someone you know who [hires freelancers](/people-who-hire-freelancers/) (or did at some point).

If you've done that, consider conducting an [address book audit](/address-book-audit/) to find some more people worth reaching out to.
