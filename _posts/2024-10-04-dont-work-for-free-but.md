title: "Don't work for free, but"

... spend as much time as you like demonstrating your expertise to [someone who might hire you](/people-who-hire-freelancers). Especially if the time you spend meets these criteria:

- It doesn't feel like you're being taken advantage of
- It feels like it's moving in the direction of a paid engagement
- It helps you decide whether you _want_ to work with this client
- It doesn't feel like a waste of time for either of you

It's common to structure this "free consultation" time into a single "[discovery call](https://www.gong.io/blog/what-is-a-discovery-call/)" during which you decide whether they really are an eligible client, gather the information you need to price and pitch your services, and agree on how to proceed—a followup call, a proposal, meeting other people on their team, etc. 

_Hopefully_ the potential client gets something out of this call, too—increased clarity on their situation, some ideas for approaches they hadn't considered, help prioritizing the issues they're facing, etc.

"It's common" means if you tell someone "let's have a discovery call" they will probably know what that means and know what to expect. So feel free to design your own discovery call agenda, follow it closely, and draw a firm boundary around how much time you'll spend in conversation before you start charging ... but also, feel free not to.

They won't hire you until the [timing is right](/timing-is-everything-unfortunately), and sometimes a collaboration feels promising but not urgent. So if you like, just meet with people, talk about their problems, offer a helpful perspective based on your expertise, [make sure they know you're open to paying gigs](/let-people-know-youre-freelancing), but give yourself more time before you pitch.

You might say something like this:

> Thanks for walking me through your ... _complex_ analytics situation. I see how you got here, I see how it's important, and I see how it's not going to be an easy fix. Hope you found some of my suggestions to be worth trying out, even if they don't solve all your problems.
> 
> I wanted to ask if you'd be open to another freeform session like that, maybe sometime next week? Seems like we only scratched the surface, and I'd like to learn more.
> 
> And for the record, I do of course charge for analytics help, but I don't want to rush into a pitch until I'm confident I can help at a price that's well worth it to you. Not sure if that's where this is headed just yet! But I'd love to keep talking.

Having periodic chats about a potential client's problem is a great way to [stay in touch](/stay-in-touch-with-potential-clients-forever) as long as it takes for the problem to become a priority, and practically ensures it'll be you they hire to help, when they hire.

So as long as it's not too taxing on your schedule and mental energies—say, a 45-minute call every other month—show up and be helpful for free.
