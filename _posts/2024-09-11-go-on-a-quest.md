If you find yourself hesitating to reach out to potential clients: Good.

Your discomfort is a signal that your request—as currently formulated—is too needy, too salesy, or somehow inauthentic. Fix the request and fix the hesitation.

The way to do this is to stop trying to talk about the services you can provide, and get curious about the challenges and insights of your potential clients.

[Go up a level](/go-up-a-level) from the work you do, and start asking about problems, projects, priorities. Before long you'll encounter a very specific, industry- or department-specific question that is (a) related to your services and (b) genuinely interesting to you.

Some examples:

- At what point to creative agency founders bring in operations help? (In other words, how chaotic do things have to get before they recognize they need structure?)
- How do engineering managers on conversion optimization teams deal with unpredictable development workloads?
- At what point in their company's growth do health tech startup marketing leaders start to see medical education as a viable strategy? (Do they ever?)
- Considering most ecommerce best practices are designed around lower-cost, lower-consideration purchases on high traffic sites, how do low traffic, high ticket ecomm owners address cart abandonment—or do they?

If you've got a question, you've got a quest. Since you've already [let people know you're freelancing](/let-people-know-youre-freelancing), now's a good time to get back in touch with them and tell people about it. Something like this:

> I'm trying to find out how `{person}` approaches `{problem}`. Do you happen to know anyone who might have an opinion on that?

Hopefully you'll get a couple of introductions, and hopefully you no longer feel hesitant to have the conversation—because you no longer have to figure out how to work in your sales pitch. The _very fact that you're asking the question_ conveys that you have expertise in the area, and if they want to hire you to help, they'll ask.

Just focus on listening. Remember, it might be [years](/timing-is-everything-unfortunately) before the person you're talking to needs your help. Connect, learn what you can, and [stay in touch](/stay-in-touch-with-potential-clients-forever).
