> My sister is a real "connector."
> 
> When I was cleaning houses, she told some of her friends about my business and they ended up becoming clients.
> 
> Years later, after I started book coaching, she referred a friend of a friend of hers to me—a state representative, which led to a very satisfying project.
> 
> Of course, I've returned the favor and sent clients her way as well.
