Here's a simple way to ask for help without creating any weird vibes:

> I'm trying to figure out X, and I think of you as someone who knows about that.
> 
> Any chance you're open to a quick back-and-forth, either on a 15min call or here in email? No worries if now's not a good time.

These are the essential components, in case you want to remix it or rewrite it:

**Sincerity.** Don't send this message if you don't actually care about X!

**Clarity and vulnerability.** You want help, so you just come out and ask for it. This keeps the recipient from having to guess what your ulterior motive might be.

**Easy to say yes.** If they're open to helping they can just reply "Sure", or "Email's best, how can I help?"

**Easy to say no.** You've provided a plausible excuse to say no, or (more likely) ignore the message. This spares the recipient any guilt they might feel if you didn't provide an out. And when you come back in a few months to reach out again, it's easy to pick up the thread. ("Well, I learned Y about X, anyway, ...")

## Examples of 'X'

- "... whether I should be pitching agencies or brands."
- "... how to find startups that need operations help."
- "... how to reach solo creators who need video editing help."
- "... what sized company will actually hire an analytics consultant."
- "... how to charge for branding work."

A good 'X' is specific (don't say "I'm trying to figure out marketing") and is something the recipient does in fact know about.

## Other notes

- The template says "... here in email." Depending on who you're talking to, it might say "here in DMs," "here in chat," "here in Slack," etc.
- Maybe this conversation will lead directly to a paying gig, and maybe you _know_ that's a possibility ... and maybe _they_ even realize it too. That's fine, and shouldn't make things awkward as long as you're _really trying to figure out X_
